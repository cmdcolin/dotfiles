## Old music player setups

### cmus setup

I used to use cmus command line audio player. It worked well but I never felt
entirely comfy in it. Nevertheless here are some notes

#### Recently added playlist

I had a "Recently added" playlist in cmus generated by a crontab

```
* * * * * find ~/Music -type f -exec stat --printf "\%Z\t\%n\n" {} +|sort -rn|tail -n 5000|cut -f2|grep -v jpg|grep -v jpeg > ~/.config/cmus/recently_added.pl
```

Note the usage of stat with %Z which is "time of last status change", which
helps with files unpacked from zip files and is different from standard
measures of file time such as "created, last access, and last modification"

### Recently played playlist

I also used set_status_display_program to append the currently playing track to
text file, creating a "recently played playlist", see
[cmus_recently_played.sh](https://github.com/cmdcolin/dotfiles/blob/master/cmus_recently_played.sh)

### Playlist browser

I created a playlist browser by navigating to the folder containing these
recently added and recently played text files using the cmus file browser
(press 5)

### Wishlist for cmus

- File watcher
- Easier to use recently added/recently played
- GUI frontend

## Vim setup iterations

- Used very raw setup for a long time with no plugins
- Then got vim-plug and used w0rp/ale plugin for auto-lint-on-save
- Then tried to get Nerdtree to work with my setup
- Then tried to get vim-vinegar to display in a sidebar as an alternative
- Then got rid of sidebar preferring to auto-launch finding files using Fzf
- Then moved to coc.nvim and neovim for LSP support
