# my dotfiles

A list of my dotfiles

Uses https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop for managing dotfiles

Includes

- tmux with weather using wttr.in in statusline
- zshrc with zplug and dracula/zsh theme
- vim with vim-plug

## Install

First install zplug with linuxbrew or homebrew

    brew install zplug

Use python 3

    pip3 install dotdrop
    git clone https://github.com/cmdcolin/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    dotdrop install

## Details about my setup

* Computer - Samsung laptop with 8gb RAM, 256gb SSD, hi-res screen
* OS - Ubuntu 18.10
* Music player - Cantata (not fully satisfied, as a windows convert foobar2000 was really good but I don't want to run it under wine)
* Text editor - gVIM. Tried Atom but the vim mode support was very bad
* Browser - Chromium
* Browser Add-ons - Dark Reader

Notes, not currently super happy with Cantata at the moment, I need really good recently added/recently played autoplaylists

Currently trying to improve my vim setup to basically be a full IDE
