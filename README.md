linux with gtk4-rs

Progress is slow on it but it does play MP3s :)

I also made an app, ytshuffle, to load entire channels worth of youtubes and
browse like a music library. See <https://cmdcolin.github.io/ytshuffle/>

## Note

I have gotten repetitive strain injury in the past, and some of my weird config
is trying to help with that, for example there are many 'double tap' key
commands which kinda help me from contorting my hand. See
