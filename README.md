# my dotfiles

A list of my dotfiles

Includes

- tmux
- zsh
- neovim w/ lazyvim

## Install

For nvim, cp init.lua to ~/.config/nvim/init.lua

For other stuff e.g. zsh, cp the .zshrc to ~/.zshrc and so on

## Details about my setup

- Computer - Dell laptop with 32gb RAM, 512GB SSD
- OS - Ubuntu 24.10
- Music player - [fml9000](https://github.com/cmdcolin/fml9000) or
  [ytshuffle](https://cmdcolin.github.io/ytshuffle/)
- Text editor - neovim nightly
- Browser - Firefox
- Browser Add-ons - Dark Reader, uBlock origin

I perform a lot of work in tmux+neovim where I split the screen vertically
and/or horizontally

If needed I make a new tmux tab

I close and re-open nvim a lot in doing so

I don't use any file browser type sidebar, and instead just use a lot of quick
searches

## Random other notes

### Music player setup

I started creating my own music player to try to bring my foobar2000 to native
linux with gtk4-rs

Progress is slow on it but it does play MP3s :)

I also made an app, ytshuffle, to load entire channels worth of youtubes and
browse like a music library. See <https://cmdcolin.github.io/ytshuffle/>

## Note

I have gotten repetitive strain injury in the past, and some of my weird config
is trying to help with that, for example there are many 'double tap' key
commands which kinda help me from contorting my hand. See
