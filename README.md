## Details about my setup

* Computer - Samsung laptop with 8gb RAM, 256gb SSD, hi-res screen
* OS - Ubuntu 18.10
* Music player - cmus
* Text editor - vim. Tried Atom but the vim mode support was very bad
* Browser - Chromium
* Browser Add-ons - Dark Reader


### C*mus notes


I have a "Recently added" playlist in cmus generated by a crontab

    * * * * * find ~/Music -type f -exec stat --printf "\%Z\t\%n\n" {} +|sort -rn|tail -n 5000|cut -f2|grep -v jpg|grep -v jpeg > ~/.config/cmus/recently_added.pl
    
I also use set_status_display_program to make a recently_played playlist

Both of these files are in a specific folder that I navigate to in the browser (press 5) view of cmus
